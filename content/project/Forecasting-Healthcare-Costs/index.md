**Linear regression** is one of the most important algorithms under the supervised learning category in Machine Learning. It is also the simplest and commonly used model for predictive analysis. Using this we explore the personal health dataset and predict treatment and insurance costs.

In this use case, concepts of linear regression, EDA, feature engineering and selection,R-squared and Mean Squared error are explained effectively.
