The cultural diversity is quite evident which also gives the feeling of a sense of inclusion.\nBoth Paris and London seem to offer a vacation stay or a romantic getaway with a lot of places to explore, beautiful landscapes, amazing food and a wide variety of culture.

Interestingly, Scala takes 7 seconds more for processing the small file rather than the larger file.\nFor execution engines, we observe that the Spark engine has the least execution time while Hadoop’s Mapreduce engine has the highest execution time.
