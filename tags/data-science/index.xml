We explored both the cities based on their postal codes and then extrapolated the common venues present in each of the neighbourhoods finally concluding with clustering similar neighbourhoods together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We could see that each of the neighbourhoods in both the cities have a wide variety of experiences to offer which is unique in it&amp;rsquo;s own way. The cultural diversity is quite evident which also gives the feeling of a sense of inclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both Paris and London seem to offer a vacation stay or a romantic getaway with a lot of places to explore, beautiful landscapes, amazing food and a wide variety of culture. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s up to the stakeholders to decide which experience they would prefer more and which would more to their liking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Regression on Personal Health Data</title><link>https://thomas-george-t.github.io/project/regression-on-personal-health-data/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thomas-george-t.github.io/project/regression-on-personal-health-data/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Linear regression&lt;/strong> is one of the most important algorithms under the supervised learning category in Machine Learning. It is also the simplest and commonly used model for predictive analysis. Using this we explore the personal health dataset and predict treatment and insurance costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this use case, concepts of linear regression, EDA, feature engineering and selection,R-squared and Mean Squared error are explained effectively.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
